Secondly, even your newborn has ate just hour ago and has napped long before that time, does not mean that your baby not hungry. This concept applies diaper changes, feedings, naps, etc.) The only real indicator your baby... and believe when tell you that your newborn will find way tell you what she wants.

This product was frustrating.Me and husband found that was easier and more efficient simply use notepad. wear watches, just recorded the time each activity (i.e. what time baby went sleep and how long slept what time baby ate and how much ate). This product doesn't have log, you couldn't possibly look back the activity throughout the day week and measure how much baby has been eating and sleeping. just set different timers.I would not buy this product again and cannot recommend anyone. think the standard notepad the best option.Also, another option that think would great for this purpose iphone/ipod/ Smartphone APP called the Similac Smartmoms Baby Journal. completely free download onto any device that reads APPS. has all the same functions this device but includes pictures well chance mark how full baby's diaper was his last change.

She was suffering from some acid reflux and would often spit her sleep while lying flat. tried elevating her bassinet but that didn't work. She never slept for more than 20-30 minutes flat bassinet crib. This sleeper was lifesaver. Her first night she slept hours straight it. Now, she sleeps least 6-8 hours straight, wakes for bottle, and sleeps again for another 2-3 hours. But only complaint that really isn't suitable for babies for long period time. While enjoyed sleeping while she slept for long periods, she now addicted the sleeper (she's mos). It's been really hard weaning her off it! This sounds silly, but it's huge transition from this inclined, cozy, rocking sleep environment stiff mattress large crib. Any tips other parents have, would welcome them! That's the only reason give stars, I'd recommend parents only use sparingly help babies get their acid reflux flare ups under control and maybe for occassional naps. was lifesaver, can't complain, but now have some regrets. Again, any tips how wean babies off this sleeper would appreciated!!! :)I'm updating previous review, which I'm not sure alot people for this product. finally transitioned 6-month old crib from this sleeper. was sooo painful, with many nights crying. Although helped the short-term, really regret using the rock play. The transition too hard.

Portability (or called portability) not worth it. Weaker battery/pump weakens over time experience, but had used one. Uses different Medela flanges and parts than every other pump they make. Hard find replacement parts local (i.e. your local Target Craigslist). Medela's most expensive pump don't understand why. Their others seem stronger and parts are everywhere.- Medela Pump Style Strong pump, nice carry bag, parts available everywhere, including your local Target. Expensive ($300-ish). Recommended you can afford your insurance pays.- Lansinoh Affinity Pro Best value for the money you have pay for yourself. Cheapest (approx. $100) and pump good Medela Pump Style. Cons: Parts come easily disconnected flanges you are constantly re-tightening them you pump. Mainly just annoying. Parts aren't sold locally Target, you get work and forgot your flanges, you travel and lose them, there's buying Target. You've got their online store for spare parts and wait mail.DETAILS:The first thing you should know that your health insurance now required provide pump for you. That being said, it's often painful process that requires lot calls/work your part find out what they provide, find medical durable equipment provider who actually sells them, and then order. They often won't let you just buy off Amazon your local Target. They also often buy only the pump, extra parts case you want sets for work, bag, etc.I'm first time mom with month old, but pump pretty frequenty, esp now that back work. I've used pumps far the Lansinoh Affinity Pro, Medela Pump Style, and Medela Freestyle. This happened because another mom gave her Medela Freestyle when she was done with and thousands extra parts and bottles with expensive calma nipples (my baby hated these, the way, but hers loved).I began using the Freestyle and seemed work pretty well but had frame reference. took approx minutes pump sometimes few min more, sometimes few min less. It's lightweight and they make you can walk around with it. You can, but you don't really want to. you walk fast and your bottles fill with milk, they will slosh and spill (and you will cry). you bend over anything, they will spill (and you will cry). you can only move these very slowly. And you put the pump kitchen counter surface, will vibrate off the counter and fall off. You can place kitchen towel under make stay place and something stationary, like chop veggies. And you have move, you can slowly and don't bend over (can bend down boobs and chest right, very slowly).I used the Freestyle month two, but began die. still works, but was losing its power. I'm sure battery dying like we've all seen happen with our laptops and other products. was taking min pump. But must note got this from friend. She has kids and she may have used with both, I'm not sure. But didn't want risk and buy another one, given the issue with the parts uses different parts than any other Medela pump and they aren't easily found Target. And it's Medela's most expensive pump, nearly $400 Target.I opted get pump through insurance, which stopped offering Medela I'm sure because it's the most expensive. offered Lansinoh, which inly $100 but the review were pretty good went with that. borrowed Medela Pump Style (brand new) from friend while waiting for Lansinoh come from insurance. The Medela Pump Style was very strong stronger than the Freestyle. Quick min pumping. liked lot, but bit over $300. And you are definitely tied down and can't move when you pump (plugged into wall) unlike the Freestyle. bit annoying, but not worth giving pumping strength for the tiny bit portability with the Freestyle.The Lansinoh pretty darn strong pump too. think nearly equal the expensive Medela. can pump min well, sometimes 15. And it's just over $100. the best value you have buy yourself. The drawback carry bag (not big deal) and some the flanges and items come unscrewed easily and find myself always tightening. Annoying, but doesn't seem harm pumping. Also, you must buy spare parts online and wait you step part and break like did connector), week two forever you work and pump daily. you may need spend the extra $40 advance and buy entire 2nd set parts.And forgot flanges one day and went Target hoping buy wouldn't have drive home from work but noted above, they don't sell. They only sell the pump, not spare parts. Only Medela spare parts are everywhere. again, another reason spend $40 their site and buy spare parts advance. you pay yourself, you are still only spending around $160 (with spare parts) $330 Medela (no spare parts, but carry bag).Make sure you order right Lansinoh parts online too Affinity Affinity Pro. Easy confuse and got wrong parts. Customer service answered instantly when called (no wait) and send new connector free for error ($5.70 plus shipping). that was impressive.\",\n",

Both are snug.Nice colors All the colors have are nice. None have faded bled the wash.Cons:The Big Baby and Mega Baby sizes are too long. There much excess fabric that hangs down. two year old can still fit the Mega Baby size, lengthwise, because sooo long.Does stretch out after many uses. You can fix that tossing the washer and then tumble dry. (It says line dry but who has time for that? We've always tumbled dry with problems.)Fingers can creep out the top and scratch the face. He's never managed get anything more than his fingers out, but just warning that can happen.**Biggest con You have keep buying bigger sizes you want continue use they grow. you buy two each size (so that you'll always have one handy one the wash), then that's over one hundred dollars swaddle blankets. Yikes!!**Hard use you need put baby someplace with straps like bouncy seat swingTerrible return policy from Woombie only unused and unwashed are accepted for returns with 15% restocking fee!!The Miracle Blanket have two one pink and one blue. used these with daughter until she rolled over from back front, about eight/nine months old.Pros:Fits any size baby. It's super long wrap, there's way that your baby will ever too big fit width-wise. Lengthwise our daughter outgrew around four months. Then just stopped putting her feet the pouch but keep wrapping her arms. Still worked great!! Also you leave the feet out, it's easy put the baby someplace with three point harness like bouncy seat swing.Can only purchase two and lasts until you need stop swaddling!Colors are nice never faded bled wash.**Best pro** Miracle Blanket has amazing customer service. One ours got hole after three months use. Miracle Blanket replaced free charge, not even charging for shipping the new blanket return shipping. Doesn't matter where you bought they will replace for you and fix the old one and donate kids need. AWESOME!Cons:Learning curve Babysitters and grandma had extremely hard time learning how use this. The first time, despite demonstration before left, our babysitter put our daughter upside down that the foot pouch was like little hood!The blanket has weakness where the foot pouch sewn onto the main piece. After much use, develops hole from being pulled baby kicking moving the feet and out the pouch. Both our blankets developed one. had Miracle Blanket replace one, but decided just keep going with the other one. The hole never got bigger that the radius straw but it's definitely weakness the fabric.Hands are down the side This was what our daughter liked, but our son hated it, guess could pro con.Overall, would recommend either. You just have think about what your baby likes. think the Miracle Blanket better for baby who really needs firm swaddle with very little movement. The Woombie for babies who like their hands up. Our daughter, who required firm swaddle, just couldn't handle the amount movement the Woombie allowed. She needed much more restriction. Our son prefers the freedom arrange his arms around his chest thighs likes. you want try one, start with the Miracle Blanket first since their return policy better. Woombie would change theirs, would equally recommend them.\",\n",

Apparently I\\'ve fallen off high horse, the assembly design this thing makes Ikea assembly look like genius design, beacon pictorial assembly art, and shining example using few possible different bolt/screws combinations.

Confused yet? resorted counting the specific screws make sure was using the right one times, fact probably spent more time making sure was using the right screw than did actual assembly, was game logic figure out which screw which the part sheet and some were packed the wrong pouch.And about the hardware, drawer rails were completely plastic, even the dowels connect pieces were plastic. guess the design was tested make with plastic but the cost cutting apparent and noticeable. The drawer rails are completely made out plastic which seemed odd for such crucial part, they are also hammered into the panels and use hardware whatsoever. Not sure how much they saved with this design but doesn\\'t give much confidence that it\\'s built last. The design has also been changed and instead updating the assembly instructions they chose add separate insert call out that parts xyz are deemed longer necessary and ignore assembly, this tells the company focused saving cost updating printed manuals vs. the customer experience. There are also pre-drilled holes that are not used and add assembly confusion. Again sign \"we changed our mind but we\\'ll let the customer figure out\". Onto the pictorial assembly, download the PDF you can zoom and see the parts and orientation much more clearly than the provided print copy. Instead laying out the pieces and coming back them the same perspective, they\\'ll abruptly change direction (flip the picture) you and made question had right. The logic the assembly also suspect, stops assembly the frame mid way focus the drawers which turn draws out the time where you would have parts just strewn about the room. It\\'s odd choice and something fell into since was following directions.On the bright side, the company readily wiling send replacement and assembly parts free charge. Awesome right? manufacturer that stands behind their product but.....it could take days get your part. here now with 50\" 42\" box siting face down the nursery with assorted parts still laying around that\\'s making harder for work other parts the room now. Lesson here that yes you can get parts easily but plan plenty room assemble and prepared wait you\\'re missing hardware and/or replacement parts.We will keep the piece now that I\\'m already 80% complete but would reconsider given how much time it\\'s taken get assembly this far (4-5 hours already). paid myself $20/hr save the headaches and for easier assemble and higher quality piece could have bumped the budget different price point and gone with something else.It\\'s not terrible piece furniture but forewarned what you\\'re for.EDIT: It\\'s been days now and I\\'m still waiting for replacement parts arrive and the latest shipping update shows have another days wait.

Your wallet will thank you and you will save yourself headache. you feel like reading why, ahead.We have the Orbit Baby travel system (the frame, the base, and the infant car seat) and felt somehow trapped thought since already have the expensive base should get the Orbit toddler car seat put further use (our 12-month old baby getting too big for the infant seat). Unfortunately, were unable see the toddler car seat person because retailer seems have floor model this thing. was hesitant order online went store hoping would able take out the box further examine its functions because wasn\\'t sure whether has recline function (Orbit website does not mention this function all). went and were told the shop that they not have floor model (surprise) and that the box cannot opened. asked few questions and was assured and reassured that does, indeed, recline into very comfortable position accommodate babies and small toddlers. paid almost $400 ($360 NYC tax) and brought this thing home where discovered that DOES NOT RECLINE!!! was furious because asked different sales persons and all them assured that does recline. Every other convertible car seat the market has reclining function, especially this price point. And frankly, for almost $600 ($360 seat $220 base) should recline automatically when say \"recline\". The seat upright not understand that Orbit says designed for babies from pounds! way. son was pounds when was only 3.5 months old. There absolutely WAY 3-month old baby would ever comfortable upright position when they can\\'t even sit. Actually, they shouldn\\'t upright position this early all! tested the seat with 12-month old son who weighs pounds now and measures inches (BTW, the infant car seat for babies pounds inches, he\\'s only inch away, and frankly, he\\'s not very comfortable anymore). you think 12-mo/22-lb/31-in baby was comfortable his new toddler car seat? ... No, was not. drove for about half hour (we couldn\\'t take longer), slept and his poor head was literally resting his chest. looked horrible and very uncomfortable. For those who think normal, let assure you that not. have used Chicco and Maxi-Cosi convertible car seats Europe and they all recline, have never experienced this problem. knew instantly would returning this seat. Which exactly what did.I only owned this seat for days, therefore didn\\'t get chance experience any problems with the belt twisting reported other reviewers.Another major con that this seat has only harness slots adjust harness height (of which only the lower are allowed for rare facing installation)! That\\'s totally inadequate other convertible car seats offer more than double (Britax Next Generation: slots, Maxi-Cosi Pria: slots). This important detail (along with the fact that doesn\\'t recline and that you can\\'t use the swivel base while forward facing) conveniently not mentioned the Orbit Baby website. You\\'ll discover this when you take the seat out the box and read the manual.I contacted Orbit because still shock that such expensive car seat from company that claims innovative lacks standard features. wrote email which included the following:\"... What consumer supposed his/her baby\\'s head literally resting its chest while sleeping the seat this looks super uncomfortable for the baby and seems unsafe too. Normally, would recline the seat. But Orbit does not allow that. Why not and what supposed done instead make the baby comfortable? tested the toddler car seat with 12-month old who weighs pounds and measures inches the toddler car seat too upright and the poor baby was sleepy and his head was falling his chest all the time. have your infant car seat, which has good angle, but he\\'s outgrowing and need new seat for him. The current seat angle your toddler seat seems sort for bigger toddlers, maybe around years, but what supposed during the \"in-between\" stage from months years, when he\\'s too big for your infant seat, yet too small for your toddler seat due the non-existing recline...\"Brace yourself for the response and suggestions received from Orbit...\"We are not aware any convertible car seats that have recline position.\" ... Really??? How about Britax, Maxi-Cosi name couple (they have the same safety features like Orbit, such the EPP foam and side impact protection). Britax, for instance all their convertible car seats allow 3-position recline both while rear and forward facing. Maxi-Cosi PRIORI model has recline positions when forward facing. Maxi-Cosi PRIA has recline positions position (most reclined) and (medium recline) can used while rear facing. Position (medium recline) must used while forward facing for children pounds. Position (upright) must used while forward facing for children over pounds. Interestingly, Maxi-Cosi seems believe (just like ... maybe it\\'s just common sense) that toddlers/children pounds should seated more reclined position. Their website explains follows: These recline positions allow more reclined riding position for younger children and more upright position for older children. Not only does this provide appropriate riding position for different sized children, but the required recline angles also improve crash energy management.On the head falling forward: \"We understand your concerns and see the same phenomenon when our own children nap using the Toddler Car Seat.\" ... Phenomenon?! More like poorly designed, overpriced car seat that lacks BASIC features!\"We have never received any information from pediatricians otherwise that when children sleep these seemingly awkward positions, somehow bad for them.\" Uh, how about just incredibly uncomfortable!?\"There are many general techniques that you can use that your child more comfortable. Some include towel, foam wedge, pool noodle that can used prop the Base.\" pool noodle??? Are you kidding me? No, thank you, will not sticking any towel pool noodle under the car seat base. The towel/pool noodle option doesn\\'t seem safe and frankly very sloppy solution for $600 ensemble and honest appalled their suggestion.Rather than pool noodle, will get different car seat. extremely disappointed with the Orbit system due its lack otherwise standard features. The fact that they are not aware the reclining function tells that Orbit way behind its competitors.FYI: you think the rotating feature cool and you are planning buy for that reason, please don\\'t. This function does not compensate for the many disadvantages the seat and frankly, you can only use the rotating function when rear-facing. Once forward facing, the rotation-allowing base cannot used anymore, nor will you able dock the seat into the stroller frame (unless you want install over and over again which beyond annoying). Hence, once forward facing, the famous swivel feature cannot utilized.And you think you can just grab the toddler car seat, lift with your sleeping child and dock into the stroller frame, then trust me, you can\\'t unless you are the Incredible Hulk. The seat very bulky and heavy (22 pounds), struggled with alone, would never able lift from the back seat very awkward angle) with toddler it.

Sit and Stand(S/S) was much longer with handle configuration but Caboose was same size inside for kids. S/S was much heavier push and the little platform that comes down for the kids stand was super noisy our walk and had put for all talk and always bounces around and sounds like you are dragging something through gravel all the time. The S/S does have larger bin store things under the toddler seat but its not much bigger. like the Caboose much better, steers easier and tracks straight, lighter and less noisy and much smaller foot print. Also has steel square frame that very strong and does not bend when kids are jumping and off. The S/S seems like fights you when steering and hated that. bought green because was the cheapest, would probably buy black hides small spills better but green was much cheaper and the pads are easy wash :)** Edit 8/13/2012 **We have now used this stroller for the summer and have placed about miles sidewalk concrete walking and the rear tires are starting bald but this probably normal and hopefully will have many more miles left.

Most playpens are dark blue dark green color and offer nothing that visually appealing. This pack and play, however, offers combinations bright yellow, green, red, and blue.

But you want place your child the playpen for quick nap, you might have some difficulty due the attention- grabbing colors and interactive toys. These toys cannot removed from the walls the playpen they could definitely create distraction that could prevent some kids from falling asleep.Graco recommends this playpen for smaller kids approximately two years age. your child older, then you should not use this playpen because he/she might able climb out.

With this VTech, the noise machine sounds like it's sitting our dresser. can clearly hear son makes any noise the room.*The video display good for this price point, but still mediocre. The angle not wide enough and takes some careful positioning. have nothing compare to, but would imagine you spent more you'd get better video. You can definitely tell what you're looking at, but reminds bit looking ultrasound picture when the room dark. You can make out his head and see him moving. don't know what expected. any case, this not feature require, any video nice have. I'm not sure how useful this would with infant. son nice see he's there standing makes sound, maybe he's just dreaming.*Very easy hook up. made adjustments and just turned on. was dead out the box and needed charge, but have not lost reception anywhere our 1900 sq, foot house. Our Angelcare had cradle charger, and miss that, but the simple A/C plug works fine, too.*Talk back feature nice. Haven't used yet, but like having the option. Especially for when son jumps his big boy bed. Again, not sure this would useful for infant.I have this sitting dresser, have not tried wall ceiling mount, but would imagine you'd get better visuals you did that. is, can see son through the crib bars, but it's not the best line sight.Overall, think this great and inexpensive video monitor, and think it's more than adequate for most people's needs.\",\n",

After going back the store and hearing the display (it hadn't had batteries when initially bought), realized that that's just how is. It's comparable volume-wise average dishwasher running.* Baby will have grow into it. Like many baby items, this one goes too far the low end the recommended age. Smaller babies will moving too fast even the slowest settings.* The sturdiness comes cost terms size takes pretty good size footprint. recouped some space storing baby items underneath where there was plenty clearance space.All all, this was great swing. suspect that even the cons that I've noted above would apply many the other models the market.\",\n",

       " 'mother with young children and wanted know which bibs worked the best. have compared the Bumkins Superbib, the Babybjorn bib, the Bibbity bib, and the Bumkins sleeved bib.With first child, quickly realized that using cloth bibs and putting them the laundry after each meal was terrible idea. They would get moldy and had own dozen bibs. Then switched Bumkins Superbibs. They are very easy use. just wash them the sink after meals and hang them bib drying rack. The bibs are dry and ready use again the next meal. Bumkins Superbibs are lightweight and babies never mind wearing them. Since the pockets are soft, they don\\'t work well the bib has been kept flat drawer. always kept Superbibs hanging upside down the pocket the bib drying rack. So, the pocket dried the open position and worked better. Now third child months old and eating mushy baby food. Even with the Bumkins Superbibs, there are still always some oatmeal spills his clothes. rarely have change his entire outfit after meal, but wondered there was better bib available. So, bought BabyBjorn bib and Bibbity bib. Here are results.Both the BabyBjorn and the Bibbity bibs are SMALLER than the Bumkins Superbibs. The Babybjorn bib made hard plastic (like cup). says \"soft\" the description but that just nonsense. The Bibbity bib softer, like rubber.The Babybjorn bib difficult put the baby because hard. Even the neck strap made stiff plastic. had great difficulty adjusting the neck hole because kept hurting son\\'s neck. never could get the hole small enough keep food from escaping onto the clothes below his chin. Plan baby crying the entire time you are fiddling with his bib. The pocket the bjorn bib great and always stays open. However, because the pocket rigid, clashes with the tray. son sits chair that clips onto the countertop. The bjorn bib pocket kept getting caught under the countertop and then would yank son\\'s neck. really hated wearing this bib. The BabyBjorn bib super easy wash the sink. easy dry with towel you don\\'t need bib drying rack with this bib.The Bibbity bib much better than the BabyBjorn bib. softer and feels like rubber. was awkward put first and son was mad. However, got used it. was able get the neck hole small enough keep most the oatmeal out without hurting son\\'s neck. The pocket stays open pretty well. However, since soft, the pocket would close when son leaned forward and the pocket hit the edge the countertop/tray. So, food did slide past the closed pocket and land son\\'s lap. The Bibbity bib about inch shorter than the Bjorn bib and 2.5 inches shorter than the Bumkins Superbib. very easy wash the sink and dry with towel. think the Bibbity bib works little better than the Bumkins Superbib because the pocket catches more. However, year old daughter refused wear the Bibbity bib, and said hurt her neck. She loves wear her Bumkins Superbibs. UPDATE: son now months old and refuses wear the Bibbity bib. just too heavy and uncomfortable.Unfortunately, all these bibs left way too much food spilled month old\\'s clothes. you have baby who eats mushy baby food and grabs the spoon, regular bib just doesn\\'t give adequate protection. So, bought MORE bib. bought the Bumkins sleeved bib. was GREAT! covered everything, even his lap! could feed himself oatmeal, make huge mess, and his clothes were clean afterward! The sleeved bib very easy clean too. just wash off the kitchen sink and hang bib drying rack (which sits right next the sink). went from dripping wet completely dry hours. Since, the sleeved bib dries fast the rack, use the same bib each meal and only needed buy one sleeved bib. put the laundry every few days.UPDATE: son now months old. refuses wear the Bibbity bib all. too heavy and uncomfortable. also pulls off his Bumkins Superbibs, throws them the floor, and laughs. So, put the Bumkins Sleeved bib him for every meal. feeds himself spaghetti and makes the biggest mess you\\'ve ever seen. doesn\\'t mind wearing the sleeved bib and can\\'t get off. also does the best job protecting his clothes. wash the kitchen sink after meals and hang the bib drying rack. dry about hours. put the laundry every few days. had all over again, I\\'d probably buy Bumkins Sleeved bibs and drying rack and that\\'s it.

Carriers with waist belts are much more comfortable for the wearer (this why hiking backpacks have waist belts).The carrier bad for the baby because all the babies weight their crotch and their legs are held close together with their hips and knees straight which bad for hip development.

I've only replaced the bag once and that was around 3-4 months.Cons:-No indicator when the bag refill close the end the roll. This really only complaint. think read review somewhere that suggested putting pink line some marker the refill bags you know when it's almost out. hasn't caused any problems yet, but would helpful know when I'm almost out bag.-The lid sticks sometimes, and doesn't close all the way.

(actually cleans the playtex airvent ones, but use avent too). did breast feed also cleans avent pumps (and friend managed get another kind one!). kids love pacifires those are constantly there, and are all those teething rings. Let just tell you that you can NOT put dirty item here, you still have wash bit. This just makes sure its really clean, (my kids have maybe been sick 5-6 times, all four them put together!) This sterelizer great, and uses very little water have purifier use pure water). like another reviewer HIGHLY RECOMEND UNPLUG WHEN NOT USE! will say again, after boiling bottles and sippy cups and pacifires and teethers all night, REGISTER FOR THIS! ITs bit pricey but can gaurentee that replacements for the bottles that you disintigrated while boiling and sleeping the same time, and doctor visits and medicine for those odd illnesses due unsanitary things that your child(ren) place their mouth, will cost you more!*** P.S...

ALL the elastic has stretched the point where couple have broken. The metal adjuster has corroded which suspect has caused the already weak elastic snag and rip. I'll try post pictures. I've contacted we'll see what they say but the warranty for elastic only 180 days and didn't save the receipt (doh!). It's bummer because really like these diapers per original review but cloth diapers should last through toilet training not couple kiddos. Hasn't even lasted year live humid climate but these get sun dried per directions the corrosion should not have happened, right? dunno, maybe it's fluke and got the bunk ones. Disappointed and surprised, they haven't even outlived generic ones.FWIW/IME: all stash, pockets have proven high quality and show wear months use. will sell everything have (if can) and use prefolds/woolies, BG's and the Hero Pocket Coqui (They are ok, good for extra stuffing for nap, and I'm sucker for the cow print) exclusively with next baby.***Customer service update***Emailed customer service and they will replace them with proof purchase.
